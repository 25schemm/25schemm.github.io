	<h1> Chick-fil-A is coming to town! And more! </h1>
		<h2> Why is This Such a Big Deal? </h2>
			<p> Chick-fil-A has been something that the people around the Eau Claire area have been wanting for a long time.  When people started noticing a new building being built by the Oakwood Mall in July of 2023, people started to ask questions.  Some of those questions being how long is it going to take for the building to be built? What is being built there? What is the estimated time of its opening? When people found out it was going to be a Chick-fil-A in July of 2023 the people were thrilled.  The anticipation of a Chick-fil-A opening in Eau Claire started in May of 2021 and it was reported that a Chick-fil-A will hopefully be in Eau Claire soon, but there were no plans to make it happen at that time. </p>
		<h2> What Happened when it Finally Opened? </h2>
			<p> When the Chick-fil-A opening date was announced people marked their calendars, they were ready to get up bright and early to get in line.  On November 30th of 2023 the line for the drive-thru got so long that roads around it going to the mall were blocked off.  The line for the drive-thru was so long that it reached all the way to Hobby Lobby.  The Chick-fil-A is on the opposite side of the mall than Hobby Lobby, with a road connecting them.  As <i> News 18 </i> put it <q> This week an alert was issued by the city as this area is already busy with traffic. Police are recommending drivers enter by Home2 Suites and to avoid entering through Golf Road. </q></p>
		<h2> What else is coming to town? </h2> 
			<p> It's not just Chick-fil-A that the city of Eau Claire is raving about, there is also a new store that opened up recently.  This store being Costco, the building is on the north side of Eau Claire off of Highway 53 and Black Avenue. The Costcos opening date was also November 30th, this store was also very anticipated in the Eau Claire area. You can probably guess how people reacted once the opening date came around.  People waited out of the building until it opened, people traveled from far away just to see the occasion. </p>
				<h3> Both store’s hours: </h3>
					<p>Chick-fil-A’s hours are 6am-9pm Monday-Thursday 6:30am-10pm Friday-Saturday and closed on Sundays.  Costco’s hours are 9am to 7pm Monday-Friday and 10am to 6pm Saturday and Sunday. </p>
